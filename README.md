# burger
This burger app uses front end development to give the user a browser to work with and uses back end to run the database for the app. In this app you choose a burger you want by inputting what kind of burger you would like to eat. This adds the burger to the database.  

Then you can choose to eat the burger effectively removing it from the database and from the browser. This app uses html css on the front end with a little JavaScript. As well as using node express and handlebars on the backend. This app uses sql for the database.
